# Simple HTML Recipe Website Project

This is a simple project of mine as a naive learner, demonstrating how to build a basic, static recipe website using only HTML. This project focuses on fundamental HTML structure, text formatting, lists, links, and image embedding.

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for a simple website featuring several recipes. The main goal of this project is to practice and solidify core HTML skills, such as:

*   Structuring a webpage with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
*   Using headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`).
*   Creating ordered lists (`<ol>`) for ingredients and unordered lists (`<ul>`) for instructions.
*   Embedding images using the `<img>` tag.
*   Linking between different pages (recipes) using the anchor (`<a>`) tag.

## Features

*   **Homepage:** A main index page listing all available recipes.
*   **Recipe Pages:** Dedicated pages for each recipe with ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
*   **Clean HTML:** Minimal use of CSS or JavaScript to keep the focus purely on HTML structure.
*   **Responsive (Basic):** Simple structure works on most basic web browsers.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** The only language used in this project.
