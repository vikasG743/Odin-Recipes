    <p>step by step recipe for yummy poha</p><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse Poha: Wash 1.5 cups of thick/medium poha in a colander under running water for 15–20 seconds until soft but not mushy, then set aside to drain.</li>
        <li>Season Rice: Sprinkle salt, turmeric, and a pinch of sugar (optional) over the wet poha and toss gently.</li>
        <li>Fry Peanuts: Heat 1.5 tablespoons of oil in a pan, fry 2 tablespoons of peanuts until crunchy, then remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Temper Spices: In the same oil, add 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds; once they splutter, add 1/2 teaspoon cumin, curry leaves, and green chillies.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add one finely chopped onion and sauté until translucent (add small diced potatoes now if desired and cook until tender).</li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients: Add the seasoned poha and fried peanuts to the pan, mixing gently with a light hand to avoid breaking the flakes.</li>
        <li>Steam: Cover the pan and let it steam on the lowest heat for 2–3 minutes to meld the flavours.</li>
        <li>Final Touch: Turn off the heat, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top, and mix once more.</li>
        <li>Garnish & Serve: Top with fresh coriander leaves, nylon sev, or grated coconut.</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Pro Tips for Success</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><em>The Squeeze Test: To ensure the poha is ready, press a flake between your thumb and forefinger; it should mash easily.</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>Avoid Dryness: If the poha feels too dry after mixing, sprinkle 1–2 tablespoons of water over it before steaming.</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>Regional Twist: For Indori Poha, add fennel seeds (saunf) to the tempering and serve with Jeeravan Masala. 
</em></strong></li>
