    <p>step by step recipe for jeera rice</p><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse & Soak: Wash 1 cup of Basmati rice until the water runs clear and soak it for 20–30 minutes to ensure long, fluffy grains.</li>
        <li>Temper Spices: Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pan and add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds (jeera) until they crackle and become aromatic.</li>
        <li>Sauté Rice: Drain the soaked rice completely and gently sauté it in the pan for 1–2 minutes to coat each grain with the tempered ghee and spices.</li>
        <li>Boil & Simmer: Add 2 cups of water and salt to taste, bring to a rolling boil, then cover and simmer on low heat for 12–15 minutes until the water is fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Rest & Fluff: Turn off the heat and let the rice sit covered for 5 minutes before gently fluffing it with a fork and garnishing with fresh coriander. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong>For a restaurant-style touch, add a few drops of lemon juice while the rice is simmering to keep the grains separate and brilliant white.
