    <p>step by step recipe for yummy Upma</p><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast Rava: Dry roast 1 cup of semolina (suji/rava) in a pan on medium heat until fragrant and crunchy, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Tempering: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee and add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds until they splutter.</li>
        <li>Add Lentils & Nuts: Stir in 1 teaspoon each of urad dal and chana dal, plus 8–10 cashews, frying until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add 1 chopped onion, 1–2 green chilies, 1 sprig of curry leaves, and 1 teaspoon of grated ginger; sauté until onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Boil Water: Pour in 3 cups of water (for soft upma) or 2.5 cups (for fluffy upma) and add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine: Once the water boils vigorously, lower the flame and add the roasted rava in a slow stream while stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Cover the pan and cook on the lowest heat for 2–4 minutes until the water is fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Finish & Fluff: Turn off the heat, stir in a teaspoon of ghee and a squeeze of lemon juice, then let it rest covered for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. </li>
    </ol>
